This is the 2nd task in which we have to predict the optimum no. of clusters from the iris dataset.
I have used the Python programming language to achieve this task.
This is done by  importing the required libraries and using kmeans to find the elbow point and then calculating the wcss to reppresent it visually.
Thank you.
