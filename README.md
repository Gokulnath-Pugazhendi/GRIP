Hello all ! I'm Gokulnath.P. I'm a sophomore in PTU and currently a Data Science intern at The Sparks Foundation. These are my 2 tasks using both Supervised and Unsupervised ML. 
My first task is to predict the percentage of a student if he studies for 9.25 hrs/day. I have used the R programming language to complete this task.
